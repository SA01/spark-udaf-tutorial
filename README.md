### Summary of the Article:

This article walks through the process of creating and using **User-Defined Aggregate Functions (UDAFs)** in Apache Spark. Key topics covered include:

- **Introduction to UDAFs**: Learn the fundamentals of UDAFs and how they differ from standard user-defined functions (UDFs).
- **Implementing UDAFs in Spark**: Step-by-step instructions on how to create and register UDAFs in PySpark and Scala.

The code in this repository allows you to follow along with the examples in the article and provides hands-on experience in creating and using UDAFs in Spark for complex aggregations.
